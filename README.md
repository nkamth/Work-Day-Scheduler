# Third-Party APIs: Work Day Scheduler :

Created a simple calendar application that allows the user to save events for each hour of the day. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

The starter code uses the [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/) library to work with date and time, but you're free to use a different JavaScript solution to handle this functionality because Moment.js is considered a "legacy" product. Learn more about these other solutions in the [Moment.js project status page.](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/-project-status/).

## Description :

```
This application is made for  AN employee with a busy schedule so that
USER CAN add important events to a daily planner
SO THAT USER can manage the time effectively.
```

## Acceptance Criteria :
